# Ansible Raspberry Pi

Ansible RPI Playbooks for learning Ansible. These were playbooks I created while going through the [Ansible Documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/)

## Playbooks

- [Adding Multiple Files to Remote Hosts](https://github.com/BaReinhard/ansible_rpi/tree/master/playbooks/multiple-files)
- [Check the OS Release Information of each Remote Host](https://github.com/BaReinhard/ansible_rpi/tree/master/playbooks/os-release)
- [Configure Multiple Remote Hosts with a WPA Supplicant File with Updating Wifi Information](https://github.com/BaReinhard/ansible_rpi/tree/master/playbooks/wpa-init)
